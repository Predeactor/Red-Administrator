# Leaving Red

I do not have any reasons to give about this. It's most probably none of your business and you'll be just here reading this to hear someone's story that could potentially make unwanted drama. I still have a few words to say.
I'm not gonna act like others did before me, I am thinking of either Draper or owo, where one did some big long lines of words to explain what's going on here and the other just to make more and more drama by putting spicy bullshit into our plates.

I just want to say that I really can't hold it anymore, it's 2 years since I'm in the community, let's remember that the server is now 6 years old, so I like... saw 1/3 of all things. And I've been pissed of since long, and the beginning.

Some peoples behavior are pissing me off, most especially these recent days, and even if I'm leaving after a really dumb "dispute" in [#general](https://canary.discord.com/channels/133049272517001216/133081046869737472/907760558567215104) that is not even one, (that's really dumb of me to use that word), that is just nothing, in fact it's the most tiny argument I can have in here compared to all others. It was just the too much for me, but I am not blamming Flame & Jack for that, nah, you guys are good peoples, I really don't think you've been ever problematic to me.
Red is my favorite project, but the community is becoming... something I don't want to see, nor deal anymore, I'm just in need of fresh air, if we can says so.

I wish you all the best guys.
I hope I'll come back some days too, but I am too fucking annoyed to come back. I'll be *so tempted* to know what y'all say behind my back, but I hope I won't do that mistake to me or that pleasure to anyone.
Here is a screenshot of my roles before I left Red, in case I am coming back.

# Cogs

### Falx

Your favorite guild manager.
If you want to know where your bot is, where you want your bot to be invited, or just want to look cool with this cog, well you can without having to open Discord's Developers tabs!
It acts as a whitelist only, you add a guild with a reason and done!
When your bot leave the guild, it gets removed from the whitelist or not if you want to, it's all up to you! Ideal to manage where your bot will be and working with a team.

### RemoteBan

Ban or hackban users you do not want in the guilds you manage by running a command in any servers you are in.
Using this cog, you can ban anyone you want, and anywhere. This will give you a nice looking result summary telling you what happened during processing bans or unban.
This cog is meant for servers managers, it is NOT made for middle/big bots and is highly discouraged to install this cog.

### MyMembers

Whenever you want to know when one of your members has joined your guild, when he created his account, get information about them, MyMembers is **__THE__** cog for that job!
It allows you to have a clear and extremely complete view about the members of your guild with the ability to drop you a JSON representation of one of your members, containing a shit ton of information about them
It takes all possible properties that a member can had as long as it's an interesting information and is not a problem for others users.
It is really useful for moderators/administrators when it comes to recognize one certain person.
